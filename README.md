**PhD Year 3 Student**  

I am a third-year PhD student at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), supervised by Dr. Roy Ka-Wei Lee. My research focuses on multimodal AI and AI for social good. I joined SUTD in 2018 under the Senior Middle 2 (SM2) Scholarship, completed my bachelorâ€™s degree in 2022 with the Top Student Award, and subsequently worked as a research assistant before starting my PhD in 2023. My work explores multimodal understanding for social applications, and I have interned at Tencent (2025) and published or submitted papers to venues including ACM MM, WWW, IJCAI, and AAAI.
âœ¨ Current Plan: **Seeking collaborations and visiting scholar opportunities in streaming video understanding and Video-LLMs. Please feel free to reach out via email.**
